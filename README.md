**Turn your plain text menu into stunning, professional food photography in seconds. Eliminate the cost and complexity of photoshoots.**

## 🌟 Overview

For restaurants, high-quality food photography is the single most powerful tool for driving sales and capturing attention online. However, professional photoshoots are costly, disruptive, and time-consuming.

**Virtual Food Photographer** is an AI-powered application designed specifically for restaurant and cafe owners. Simply input the text description of a dish from your menu, and the application generates photorealistic, appetite-inducing images of that dish. Choose a visual style (e.g., "Rustic," "Fine Dining," "Casual Cafe"), and then refine the image using simple text prompts for ultimate creative control.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **📝 Menu-to-Image Generation** | Input the text description of a dish (e.g., "Seared Scallops with Lemon-Butter Sauce and Saffron Risotto") and watch the AI instantly visualize it with photorealistic accuracy. |

## 💡 How It Works (The Chef's Workflow)

1.  **Input:** The restaurant owner copies the description of a dish (e.g., "Our Signature Truffle Burger: Wagyu patty, aged cheddar, caramelized onions, brioche bun").
2.  **Style Selection:** They choose a style from the presets (e.g., "Modern Diner Vibe").
3.  **AI Creation:** The specialized image generation model processes the detailed text description and the chosen style parameters to render a unique, high-resolution food photograph.
4.  **Polish:** The owner uses text prompts to finalize the look: *"Add a side of hand-cut fries,"* or *"Increase the focus blur on the background."*
5.  **Export:** The finished image is downloaded or sent directly to their digital menu or social media scheduler.
